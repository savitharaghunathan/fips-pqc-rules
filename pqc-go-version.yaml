    Go Version Compatibility. This Go version does not include native post-quantum
    cryptography (PQC) algorithm support.

    Go 1.24+ is required for:
    - ML-KEM (Kyber) - post-quantum key encapsulation
    - Future ML-DSA (Dilithium) support

    Impact:
    - Cannot use NIST-standardized PQC algorithms natively
    - Third-party PQC libraries required for quantum resistance
    - Mixed-version environments may have compatibility issues

    Action: Update to Go 1.24 or higher for native PQC support.
    Plan Go version upgrade as part of PQC migration strategy.
